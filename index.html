            <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>I am in my 11th year in education and my first year as Digital Learning Coach for Mount Airy City Schools. This has been a really excited career shift for me after 10 years loving teaching middle and high school science.</p>
                
            <h2>EdTech Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://workspace.google.com/"> Google Workspace</a>- I think that much of what people use other tools for can be done using the apps in Google.</li>
                <li><a href="https://jamboard.google.com/">Jamboard</a>- This is probably redundant because it is a part of Google Workspace, but Jamboard is a favorite tool of mine and has been such a wonderful tool for teachers with remote and socially distanced learners to use to collaborate.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/earth"/>Google Earth</a>- again, another Google app but this one is so great. Google Earth is a great way to make cross curriculuar connections. I love Google Lit Trips and using Earth for students to create.</li>
                <li><a href="https://info.flipgrid.com/">FlipGrid</a>- <em>How cool is flipgrid?!?!</em> This tools is such a great way for students and teachers to carry on discussions, share information, ideas, present their learning to their classmates. I could go on.</li>
                <li><a href="https://spark.adobe.com/">Adobe Spark</a>- This is a great tool for educators and students alike. I love seeing students develop professional presentations in Adobe Spark</li>
                <li><a href="https://edpuzzle.com/home">EdPuzzle</a>- This tool has proven it is worth it's weight in gold during remote learning. The ability to monitor student view progress for accountability and to embed questions within the videos for formative assessment is fantastic.</li>
            </ul>
