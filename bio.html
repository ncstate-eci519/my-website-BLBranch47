       <p>My husband, our three children and I live on a farm where we raise dairy heifers and grow hay. Our cows, horses, and other animals are my favorite hobby and I love the time our family spends together working outside.</p> 
         <p>On the occassion I have downtime from work, grad school and livestock I love to read, garden and cook. </p>
